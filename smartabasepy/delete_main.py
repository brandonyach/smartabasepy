    Sends a request to the AMS API's deleteevent endpoint to remove the event with the specified
    event ID. Requires valid authentication credentials and a positive integer event ID. In
    interactive mode, prompts for confirmation before deletion and provides status feedback.
    Returns a message indicating the success or failure of the operation.

    Args:
        event_id (int): The ID of the event to delete. Must be a positive integer.
        url (str): The AMS instance URL (e.g., 'https://example.smartabase.com/site').
        username (Optional[str]): The username for authentication. If None, uses the
            AMS_USERNAME environment variable. Defaults to None.
        password (Optional[str]): The password for authentication. If None, uses the
