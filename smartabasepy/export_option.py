class EventOption:  
    """Options for configuring event data export.

    Defines customization options for the `get_event_data` function, controlling aspects such as
    downloading attachments, cleaning column names, caching API responses, and enabling
    interactive feedback. These options allow users to tailor the event data retrieval process,
    including data formatting, performance optimization, and user experience.

    Args:
        interactive_mode (bool): Whether to print status messages during execution, such as the
            number of events retrieved. Defaults to True.
        guess_col_type (bool): Whether to infer column data types (e.g., numeric, datetime) in
            the resulting DataFrame. Defaults to True.
        convert_dates (bool): Whether to convert date columns to pandas datetime objects.
            Defaults to False.
        clean_names (bool): Whether to clean column names by converting to lowercase and
            replacing spaces with underscores. Defaults to False.
        cache (bool): Whether to cache API responses to improve performance for repeated
            requests. Defaults to True.
        include_missing_users (bool): Whether to include events for users not found in user
            data, ensuring all events are represented. Defaults to False.
        download_attachment (bool): Whether to download attachments associated with events.
            Defaults to False.
        attachment_directory (Optional[str]): Directory path to save downloaded attachments.
            If None, uses the current working directory. Ignored if download_attachment is
            False. Defaults to None.

    Attributes:
        interactive_mode (bool): Indicates whether interactive mode is enabled.
        guess_col_type (bool): Indicates whether column type inference is enabled.
        convert_dates (bool): Indicates whether date conversion is enabled.
        clean_names (bool): Indicates whether column name cleaning is enabled.
        cache (bool): Indicates whether caching is enabled.
        include_missing_users (bool): Indicates whether missing users are included.
        download_attachment (bool): Indicates whether attachment downloading is enabled.
        attachment_directory (Optional[str]): The directory for saving attachments.
        attachment_count (int): The number of attachments downloaded (set during processing).
